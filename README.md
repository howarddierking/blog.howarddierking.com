My personal blog. Also a testbed for experiments with different Node-based static site generators

## To run locally

Even though the site is built using Node.js, you don't need to have any development tools on your computer besides Docker ([Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) | [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). To build the site and make it available via http://localhost, simply navigate to the project directory and run the following.

`docker-compose up`
